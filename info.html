The ocean is the worlds biggest carbon sink, taking around 90% of the heat emmited by climate change. Scientists predict that half of all ocean life will be gone by 2100 because of this.
<br> <br>Marine life affects billions of people world wide. 3.3 million people depend on fish for protein and 60 million people depend of marine life to make a living.
<br> <br>Not only is fish dying but the sea levels are also rising. This is mostly because of melting ice caps. The rate of which sea levels rise has doubled over the last 30 years. This causes a lot of natural disasters such as storm surges,flooding, erosion and landslides.
<br> <br>The rise in ocean tempature also affects marine ecosystems, mainly the coral reefs. Coral reefs are the backbone of most ecosystems in the ocean and they are getting destoryed due to increase in tempature. As of today 60% of the oceans ecosystem has already been destoryed. If more warming contiunes corals reefs could disapper completly. To put it into perspective the temputare of water has rising bt 1.1 degrees today, a rise of 1.5 degrees will destory 70-90% of coral which a 2 degree increase can almost wipe out the enitre speices.  </p>
